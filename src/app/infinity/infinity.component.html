            <p>The infinity pool is located on Sands SkyPark where you can eat, swim and relax enjoying views of Singapore. The Sands SkyPark lies on top of the three hotel towers at Marina Bay Sands. The SkyPark has the world's longest elevated swimming pool, it's 146 meters long and it sits 191 meters above the ground. You can ride through the shopping mall on an indoor canal in Sampan boats styled on traditional Chinese vessels. Your eyes will widen with amazement when you see some of the huge sculptures by famous artists including a 40m-long Antony Gormley sculpture made from 16,100 steel rods.</p>
                

            There is everything you could wish for available to you, from an elegant casino to ArtScience Museum. Not one but several of the best chefs in the world are ready to serve you food from every tradition. What is unusual for a hotel is that it has its own theater where you can see famous shows from Broadway. The award-winning Banyan Tree Spa offers unique treatments that will fulfill your need to relax. There is simply too much to explain in the amount of space I have here. I would think relaxing in Sky Park has got to be worth the price of admission alone.The infinity pool is located on Sands SkyPark where you can eat, swim and relax enjoying views of Singapore.
